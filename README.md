PokerFlow

Live Project: https://pokerflow.live

PokerFlow is a full stack web application that allows players to track live poker sessions in real time. Users can clock in, record buy ins, and manage session data through a structured interface backed by a cloud hosted API.

The application is built with a React frontend, a Node.js and Express backend, and MongoDB for persistent data storage. The backend is containerized with Docker and deployed to Microsoft Azure Container Apps, making it publicly accessible.

What Problem Does It Solve?

PokerFlow solves the problem of unstructured session tracking for live poker players. Many players rely on notes apps or spreadsheets, which lack consistency and real time structure. PokerFlow provides a centralized system to record sessions, track buy ins, and maintain organized performance data that can later be analyzed for improvement.
